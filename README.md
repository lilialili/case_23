This file defines a React functional component named DataGenerator. This component generates and displays data for movie titles and credits. It also provides buttons to generate and download the data.

generateTitles(): Generates an array of synthetic movie titles with various attributes.
generateCredits(titles): Generates an array of synthetic credits linked to the movie titles.
handleGenerate(): Handles the generation of both titles and credits data arrays.
handleDownload(data, filename): Downloads a CSV file containing the given data.

This file contains tests for the DataGenerator component using the React Testing Library.

it('renders without crashing'): Checks if the component renders without any errors.
it('has a Generate Data button'): Ensures that the "Generate Data" button is present in the rendered component.
it('generates data on button click'): Simulates clicking the "Generate Data" button and checks if download buttons appear.

it('titles and credits have 100 records each after generating data'): Simulates clicking the "Generate Data" button and verifies that both titles and credits arrays have 100 records each.
it('downloads titles data'): Simulates clicking the "Generate Data" button, then the "Download Titles" button, and ensures that the download function is called.
